	vlock 2.1

	FreeBSD and Debian/kFreeBSD are now supported platforms.  Timeout support
	was added to the password prompt.  "vlock --new" now works even if stdin is
	not a terminal, e.g. from an X run command dialog.

	vlock 2.0

	A major rewrite was undertaken, though the user interface is nearly the
	same.  A new "-n,--new" command line switch was added.  This makes vlock
	switch to a new virtual console before locking and thus makes it possible to
	use vlock from an X session.

	vlock 1.4

	vlock 1.4 now supports optionally disabling the SysRQ keys while the entire
	console display is locked.  All other changes are merely cosmetical,
	cleaning up license statements, includes, and makefile rules.
