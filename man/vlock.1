.SH NAME
vlock \- Virtual Console lock program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vlock
.PP
.B vlock [ -a,--all ] [ -c,--current ] [ -n,--new] [ -s,--disable-sysrq ] [ -h,--help ] [ -v,--version ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vlock
is a program to lock one or more sessions on the Linux console.  This is
especially useful for Linux machines which have multiple users with access
to the console.  One user may lock his or her session(s) while still allowing
other users to use the system on other virtual consoles.  If desired, the
entire console may be locked and virtual console switching disabled.
.PP
By default, only the current VC (virtual console) is locked.  With the
\fB-a,--all\fR option all VCs are locked.  The locked VCs cannot be unlocked
without the invoker's password or the root password.  The root password will
always be able to unlock any or all sessions, unless disabled at compile time.
.PP
Please note that it is entirely possible to completely lock yourself out of
the console with the \fB-a,--all\fR option if you cannot remember your
password!  Unless you are able to kill vlock by logging in remotely via a
serial terminal or network, a hard reset is the only method of ``unlocking''
the display.
.PP
When locking the entire console display it is sometimes still possible to kill
vlock using the Secure Access Key (SAK) or other commands that are available
through the SysRq mechanism.  When the \fB-s,--disable-sysrq\fR option is given
the SysRq mechanism is disabled while vlock is running and reenabled on exit.
See /usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysrq.txt for more details.
.PP
\fBvlock\fR works for console sessions primarily.  To lock the entire console
display from an X session use the \fB-n,--new\fR option. \fBvlock\fR will then
switch to an empty virtual console before locking.  Giving this option implies
the \fB-a,--all\fR option.
