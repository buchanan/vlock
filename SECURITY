vlock is a denial of service tool.  The default installation is insecure in the
way that it allows any user logged into the machine, even remotely, to lock the
machine completely.  If you have a notion of trusted users it is possible to
set VLOCK_GROUP variable while installing vlock like so:

  make VLOCK_GROUP=vlock install

That way only members of the vlock group will be able to lock the machine
completely.  Others will still be able to lock their own console.

Another possibility is to install vlock with the VLOCK_GROUP set to root and
only allow use of vlock through tools like sudo.  This, however, does not bring
much advantage over the previous approach.

In the future the offending tools, vlock-new and vlock-grab, may also be
optionally protected through PAM.
