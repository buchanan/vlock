OVERVIEW
========

Plugins are a way to extend vlock's functionality.  They can define
hooks that are called at certain points in a vlock session.

Plugins are separated into two groups:  modules and scripts.  Modules
are shared objects that are loaded into vlock's address space.  They run
with the same privileges as vlock and thus are very powerful but also
dangerous.  Scripts may be any kind of executables located in vlock's
script directory.  They are run in separate processes with lowered
privileges, i.e. the same as the user who started vlock.

For simple tasks scripts should be preferred over modules.  They are
easier to develop and test and have a lower impact on security and
stability.
